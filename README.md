# Neuro Note

An application for slack that combines productivity with creativity using neural networks to help you write less, think better, and do more.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Python 3.6.5
Django 2.0.5
PostgreSQL
TensorFlow
Keras
HerokuCli

```
$ brew install < >
```

### Installing
//TODO: Flush these steps out

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment
